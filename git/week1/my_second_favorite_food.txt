Neil Perry's lamb meatballs with onion salad and hummus
This is one of my favourite dishes to cook at home. It's great to eat wrapped in warm flatbread. This quick version of hummus using tinned chickpeas turns out pretty nicely, and it's also delicious with grilled seafood or roasted poultry. You could use beef, chicken or pork mince instead of lamb for the meatballs.
